## 📝 HeyGen Script (Optimized for 3 Minutes)

Copy-paste this EXACT script into HeyGen:

```
[SCENE 1 - 0:00-0:25]

Solana's network has a critical vulnerability. Just 19 validators control 33% of all stake. The top 10 hold 23% of the network. This concentration threatens censorship resistance, stability, and security.

But what if an AI agent could fix this in real-time?

[SCENE 2 - 0:25-0:45]

Meet Validator Pulse: an autonomous AI agent that monitors all 806 Solana validators in real-time. It analyzes decentralization across four dimensions—stake distribution, performance, geographic diversity, and client diversity—then generates optimized delegation recommendations that protocols and DAOs can vote on with their wallets.

[SCENE 3 - 0:45-1:15]

Here's what makes it powerful.

First, live vote streaming—watch votes appear in real-time with 3-second updates.

Second, it's fully mobile-responsive, working seamlessly on any device.

Third, our deterministic AI algorithm ensures reproducible results for protocol governance.

And fourth, real validator stakes displayed live from Solana mainnet—no estimates, just facts.

[SCENE 4 - 1:15-1:40]

Four wallet integrations—Phantom, Solflare, Torus, and Ledger—with every vote stored in PostgreSQL.

The AI detects client types: Agave, Jito, and Firedancer, tracking the exact distribution across 806 validators.

Geographic data spans 11 countries and 12 cities.

And it's all powered by GPT-4o with a sophisticated fallback system that never fails.

[SCENE 5 - 1:40-2:15]

Let's see it in action.

Connect your wallet with one click.

Hit 'Generate Recommendation'—the AI analyzes all 806 validators in seconds.

Review the transparent AI reasoning showing exactly why each validator was chosen.

Cast your vote—approve or reject.

And watch the live vote stream update automatically as the community participates.

[SCENE 6 - 2:15-2:35]

The impact? If just 5 to 10 major protocols adopt Validator Pulse, we could increase the Nakamoto coefficient by up to 26%, reduce top-10 concentration by 4%, and expand validator diversity to 15-plus countries.

We're talking about liquid staking protocols like Marinade and Jito, DAOs managing treasuries, and validator operators optimizing their setups.

Real protocols. Real impact. Real decentralization.

[SCENE 7 - 2:35-2:50]

Built with Next.js 16, TypeScript 5, and Tailwind CSS. Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o, Solana Web3.js, and Supabase PostgreSQL.

And it's live right now on Vercel, fully functional on Solana mainnet.

This isn't a prototype—it's production-ready infrastructure that protocols can integrate today.

[SCENE 8 - 2:50-3:00]

Try it yourself at solana-ai-agent-validator.vercel.app.

Connect your wallet. Generate a recommendation. Cast your vote.

Help make Solana more decentralized.

This is Validator Pulse AI Agent—autonomous, transparent, and ready to optimize your network.

Let's build a stronger Solana together.
